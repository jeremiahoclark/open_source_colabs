            "Hercules, son of Zeus and Alcmene, was a demigod known for his immense strength and courageous feats. From a young age, he exhibited signs of his divine heritage. As a baby, Hercules strangled two snakes sent by Hera, Zeus's wife, to kill him in his cradle. This was a clear indication of his extraordinary powers. Growing up, Hercules was trained in various skills by the finest teachers in Greece. He learned archery from Eurytus, wrestling from Autolycus, and music from Linus. However, Hercules's strength was both a gift and a curse.\n",
