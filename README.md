## Introduction

Google Colab is a powerful platform that allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser. It provides a convenient environment for data analysis, machine learning, and more. This repository leverages the capabilities of Google Colab to offer a range of scripts that can help streamline your workflow and solve common problems.

## Scripts

### LinkedIn Activity Scraper

The LinkedIn Activity Scraper is a Python script that allows you to scrape recent activity data from a LinkedIn profile. It utilizes the Selenium WebDriver to automate the process of logging in to LinkedIn, navigating to the specified profile's activity page, and extracting the activity data.

To use the LinkedIn Activity Scraper, follow these steps:

1. Open the `linkedin_activity_scraper.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the provided installation commands.
3. Provide your LinkedIn login credentials and the profile link of the user whose activity you want to scrape.
4. Run the script and wait for it to complete the scraping process.
5. The scraped activity data will be saved as a JSON file named `activities.json`, which you can download from Colab.

Please note that the script requires a valid LinkedIn account and may be subject to LinkedIn's terms of service and privacy policy. Use the script responsibly and respect the privacy of others.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
